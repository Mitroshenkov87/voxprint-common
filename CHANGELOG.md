# Changelog

## 0.2.4

Safety. A component whose path is, or contains, the suite home, the models root, the shared runtime, voices, cache, projects, or state is refused, and so is a path that overlaps another component. Release deletes a directory only when it is one model's folder directly inside the models root and both the shared manifest and `models/.users.json` have no remaining users. Otherwise the ref is dropped and the files stay. `ready(app)`, `ensure_ready`, and `status` check that every required model file and runtime file is present at the expected size, so a stale status file cannot hide a wiped store. `voxprint-mdl verify --repair` clears a dangerous manifest path and does not delete files.

Codename: Malkhut.

## 0.2.3

The download window is tighter and calmer. The header motif sits inside the window, item cards use the full width, and a short queue no longer leaves an empty pane. Speed and source appear only when they mean something. Sizes follow the language: a decimal comma and a narrow space in German, Russian, Ukrainian, and Latvian. A disk error names the models folder, keeps the path under Details, and does not say the download is still waiting.

Codename: Hod.

## 0.2.2

The download window is the shared progress UI. One window shows the queue grouped by app, and a second launch focuses that window. Manage models lists what is installed and what this card can add. Closing the window leaves the worker running.

`voxprint_common.i18n` reads JSON catalogs. English is the source. German, Russian, Ukrainian, and Latvian ship with the package. `python -m voxprint_common.i18n.check` fails when a Qt call contains a hard-coded user-facing string, a key is missing, or placeholders differ.

Codename: Netzach.

## 0.2.1

The model downloader keeps a single queue, checks the shared models directory before enqueue, refuses a gated upstream that has no suite mirror, and resumes large files in several HTTP ranges. App manifests can mark a model unavailable and can run a post-install command after the digest check.

Codename: Tiferet.

## 0.2.0

VOXPrint MDL (`voxprint-mdl`) is the suite model downloader. Installers run it after copying files. Apps open their own window only when the status file reports ready. Models land in one shared directory, referenced per app, and a short disk refuses the job before the first request.

Codename: Gevurah.

## 0.1.2

`voxprint_common.power.keep_awake` blocks system sleep for a long job.

Codename: Chesed.

## 0.1.1

Build-info lookup, the splash click hook, absolute model paths under the models directory, and the release workflow that publishes the wheel.

Codename: Menuchah.

## 0.1.0

Initial shared library.

Codename: Yesod.
